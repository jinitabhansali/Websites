<p> In this week, I have started using jQuery. I have implemented simple experiments using jQuery. One of my experiments is when an image is clicked, the click event is handled by jQuery and alert is displayed. In second experiment I have handled the click event by redirecting everytime it is clicked. I am still trying some more experiments where am trying to sort collapsable lists.
